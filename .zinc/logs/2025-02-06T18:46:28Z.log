{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can prepare a commit message in a Git repository for use on the next commit action. \n\nTo do this, you can use the `-m` option with the `git commit` command, but since you want to prepare the message for the next commit, not for the current one, you can use the `git commit -m` command with the `--allow-empty` option and the `--amend` option with the next commit. However, a more straightforward way is to use `git commit --allow-empty -m` followed by `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, but this will create an extra commit in your commit history.\n\nA cleaner way to prepare a commit message for the next commit is to use the `git commit -t` command. You can create a file with your commit message, then reference that file with `git commit -t` when you make your next commit.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a file with your commit message:\n   ```bash\necho \"Your commit message\" > commit_message.txt\n```\n\n2. When you're ready to commit, use the `-t` option with `git commit` to specify the file containing your commit message:\n   ```bash\ngit commit -t commit_message.txt\n```\n\nHowever, the most common way to prepare a commit message for the next commit is to use the `git commit -m` command with the message, then if you need to make changes, you can amend the commit with `git commit --amend`. But if you want to prepare a message before making any changes, you can store it in a file or a clipboard and use it when you make your next commit.\n\nAnother option is to create an empty commit with `git commit --allow-empty`, then when you're ready to make your changes, you can use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the last commit, make your changes, then commit again with the original message using `git commit -c ORIG_HEAD`. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create an empty commit with your message:\n   ```bash\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Your commit message\"\n```\n\n2. Make your changes.\n\n3. Undo the last commit, but keep the changes:\n   ```bash\ngit reset --soft HEAD~1\n```\n\n4. Commit again with the original message:\n   ```bash\ngit commit -c ORIG_HEAD\n```","ts":1.738867610882E9}

{"role":"assistant","content":"When you run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git opens a temporary file in your default text editor, where you can write your commit message. This file is usually located in the `.git` directory of your repository, and its name is `COMMIT_EDITMSG`.\n\nHowever, before you run `git commit`, you can prepare a commit message by editing the `COMMIT_EDITMSG` file directly, but this is not recommended as it's meant to be used internally by Git.\n\nBut there's another file that Git uses as a template for the commit message: `COMMIT_EDITMSG` is created from the contents of `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` if it exists, otherwise it's created from the contents of the file specified by the `commit.template` configuration variable.\n\nIf you want to prepare a commit message for the next commit, you can create a file and set it as the commit template using the `commit.template` configuration variable.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a file with your commit message template:\n   ```bash\necho \"Your commit message\" > commit_template.txt\n```\n\n2. Set the `commit.template` configuration variable to point to your template file:\n   ```bash\ngit config commit.template commit_template.txt\n```\n\nNow, when you run `git commit` without the `-m` option, the editor will open with the contents of your template file, and you can modify it to create your commit message.\n\nNote that the `commit.template` configuration variable can be set globally or per-repository, so you can have different commit templates for different projects.","ts":1.738868036799E9}
