{"role":"assistant","content":"The functions you mentioned are part of the C standard library. Here's where they are typically declared:\n\n1. `va_start`: This function is declared in the `stdarg.h` header file. This header file provides functions for working with variable-length argument lists.\n\n2. `fflush`: This function is declared in the `stdio.h` header file. This header file provides functions for input/output operations, including file operations.\n\n3. `abort`: This function is declared in the `stdlib.h` header file. This header file provides functions for general-purpose facilities, including memory management, process control, and others.\n\nTo use these functions in your C program, you would include the corresponding header files at the top of your source file:\n\n```c\n#include <stdarg.h>  // for va_start\n#include <stdio.h>   // for fflush\n#include <stdlib.h>  // for abort\n```","ts":1.738934916222E9}
