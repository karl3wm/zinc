{"completion":"Here is a revised version of the split plan that makes it clear that the parts are separate and turns `02-functions` into a functions header file:\n\n**man/split_plan.txt**\n```\n[X] 01_introduction.txt\n[ ] 02_functions.txt (header file)\n    [ ] 02.1_memory_management.txt (separate file)\n    [ ] 02.2_memory_file_operations.txt (separate file)\n    [ ] 02.3_differential_and_patching_functions.txt (separate file)\n[ ] 03_data_structures.txt\n[ ] 04_algorithms.txt\n[ ] 05_see_also.txt\n[ ] 06_license.txt\n[ ] 07_author.txt\n[ ] 08_availability.txt\n[ ] 09_bugs.txt\n```\nAlternatively, you could reorganize the plan to make it clear that `02_functions` is a category, rather than a single file:\n\n**man/split_plan.txt**\n```\n[X] 01_introduction.txt\n[ ] Functions\n    [ ] 02.1_memory_management.txt\n    [ ] 02.2_memory_file_operations.txt\n    [ ] 02.3_differential_and_patching_functions.txt\n[ ] 03_data_structures.txt\n[ ] 04_algorithms.txt\n[ ] 05_see_also.txt\n[ ] 06_license.txt\n[ ] 07_author.txt\n[ ] 08_availability.txt\n[ ] 09_bugs.txt\n```\nThis way, it's clear that `Functions` is a category that contains multiple separate files, rather than a single file that's being generated.","ts":1.738878733739E9}
