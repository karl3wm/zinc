{"role":"assistant","content":"You can use a variable to track whether the inner loops encountered an EOF. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\nwhile true; do\n  eof_encountered=false\n\n  while IFS= read -r line; do\n    # stuff\n  done || eof_encountered=true\n\n  while IFS= read -r line; do\n    # stuff\n  done || eof_encountered=true\n\n  if $eof_encountered; then\n    break\n  fi\ndone\n```\n\nIn this code, `|| eof_encountered=true` is executed if the preceding command (the `while` loop) exits with a non-zero status, which is the case when `read` encounters an EOF.\n\nHowever, this approach has a problem: it will break the outer loop as soon as any of the inner loops encounter an EOF. If you want to break the outer loop only when all inner loops encounter an EOF, you'll need to track the status of each inner loop separately.\n\nAnother approach is to use a single `while` loop and use a `case` statement or `if` statements to determine which inner loop to execute. This approach can be more flexible and easier to manage.\n\n```bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n  # determine which inner loop to execute\n  case $some_variable in\n    value1)\n      # stuff for inner loop 1\n      ;;\n    value2)\n      # stuff for inner loop 2\n      ;;\n    *)\n      # handle unknown value\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n```\n\nIn this case, the outer loop will automatically exit when `read` encounters an EOF.\n\nIf you really need to use multiple `while` loops, you can also use a file descriptor to read from the input file, and then use the `read` command with that file descriptor. This way, you can check the status of the file descriptor after each inner loop, and break the outer loop when the file descriptor is closed (i.e., when `read` encounters an EOF).\n\n```bash\nexec 3< input_file\n\nwhile true; do\n  while IFS= read -r line <&3; do\n    # stuff\n  done\n\n  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    break\n  fi\n\n  while IFS= read -r line <&3; do\n    # stuff\n  done\n\n  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    break\n  fi\ndone\n\nexec 3>&-\n```\n\nIn this code, `exec 3< input_file` opens the input file on file descriptor 3, and `exec 3>&-` closes the file descriptor when you're done with it. The `read` command is used with file descriptor 3 by appending `<&3` to the command. The `$?` variable is used to check the exit status of the `read` command. If the exit status is non-zero, it means that `read` encountered an EOF, and the outer loop is broken.","ts":1.738873591248E9}
