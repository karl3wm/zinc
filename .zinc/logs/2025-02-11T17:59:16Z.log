{"role":"assistant","content":"To use the commit message from `commit_template.txt` when committing with Git, you can use the `-t` or `--template` option followed by the path to your template file. However, in your case, since you want to use the message directly, you can use the `-F` or `--file` option.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -F commit_template.txt\n```\n\nThis command tells Git to use the contents of `commit_template.txt` as the commit message. Make sure the file is in the correct location (or provide the full path to the file if it's not in the current directory).\n\nAlternatively, if you want to open the commit message in an editor for further modification before committing, you can use the `-t` option:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -t commit_template.txt\n```\n\nThis will open the commit message in your default editor, allowing you to make any necessary changes before committing.","ts":1.739314783498E9}
{"role":"user","content":"Can I have it seed the editor with this document automatically for every commit?\n","ts":1.739314806003E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can configure Git to use a specific template file for every commit. To do this, you can set the `commit.template` configuration variable.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global commit.template commit_template.txt\n```\n\nHowever, this will look for `commit_template.txt` in the root of your home directory (or the directory specified by the `HOME` environment variable). If your template file is in a different location, you'll need to provide the full path:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global commit.template /path/to/commit_template.txt\n```\n\nIf you want to set this configuration only for a specific repository (instead of globally), you can omit the `--global` flag:\n\n```bash\ngit config commit.template commit_template.txt\n```\n\nOnce you've set this configuration, every time you run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will open your default editor with the contents of the template file. You can then modify the message as needed before committing.","ts":1.739314809403E9}
