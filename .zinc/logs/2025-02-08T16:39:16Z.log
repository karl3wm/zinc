{"role":"assistant","content":"The warning you're seeing is due to a type conversion issue in C++. The `void*` type is a generic pointer type that can point to any type of object, but it doesn't provide any information about the type of object it points to. When you try to assign a `void*` pointer to a pointer of a specific type (in this case, `xdlclass_t**`), the compiler warns you that the conversion is invalid.\n\nTo prevent this warning, you need to explicitly cast the `void*` pointer to the correct type. Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\nvoid* ptr = /* some allocation or assignment */;\nxdlclass_t** xdl_ptr = static_cast<xdlclass_t**>(ptr);\n```\n\nBy using `static_cast`, you're telling the compiler that you know what you're doing and that the conversion is safe. However, be aware that if the conversion is not actually safe (i.e., if `ptr` doesn't actually point to an `xdlclass_t**` object), you may get undefined behavior at runtime.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `reinterpret_cast` instead of `static_cast`. The difference between the two is that `reinterpret_cast` is more permissive and will allow conversions that `static_cast` won't. However, this also means that `reinterpret_cast` can be more error-prone if used incorrectly.\n\n```cpp\nxdlclass_t** xdl_ptr = reinterpret_cast<xdlclass_t**>(ptr);\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that if you're seeing this warning, it may be a sign of a larger design issue in your code. If you're working with `void*` pointers, it's often a good idea to consider whether there's a way to use more strongly-typed pointers instead.\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to avoid the warning by changing the design of your code. For example, if you're using a function that returns a `void*` pointer, you might consider changing the function to return a more strongly-typed pointer instead.\n\nIf you're unable to change the design of your code, and you're confident that the conversion is safe, you can disable the warning using the `-fpermissive` compiler flag (as mentioned in the warning message). However, this should be a last resort, as it can mask other issues in your code.\n\nHere is an example of code before and after the explicit casting:\n\n**Before**\n```cpp\nxdlclass_t** xdl_ptr = malloc(sizeof(xdlclass_t*));\n```\n\n**After**\n```cpp\nxdlclass_t** xdl_ptr = static_cast<xdlclass_t**>(malloc(sizeof(xdlclass_t*)));\n```","ts":1.739032767253E9}
