{"role":"assistant","content":"In C++20, you can create a multiline string using the raw string literal syntax. Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\nconst char* multilineString = R\"(\n    This is a multiline string.\n    It can span multiple lines.\n)\";\n\n// or with std::string\n\n#include <string>\n\nstd::string multilineString = R\"(\n    This is a multiline string.\n    It can span multiple lines.\n)\";\n```\n\nHowever, the raw string literal syntax was actually introduced in C++11, not C++20. \n\nOne thing to note is that the raw string literal syntax allows you to specify a delimiter. This can be useful if your string contains the `)\"` sequence, which would otherwise terminate the string. Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\nconst char* multilineString = R\"delimiter(\n    This is a multiline string.\n    It can span multiple lines.\n)delimiter\";\n```\n\nIn this case, the string will only be terminated when the `)delimiter` sequence is encountered. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the raw string literal syntax does not perform any escaping, so if you need to include special characters in your string, you don't need to escape them. For example:\n\n```cpp\nconst char* path = R\"(C:\\Windows\\System32)\";\n```","ts":1.738609881918E9}
