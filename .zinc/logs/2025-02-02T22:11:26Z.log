{"role":"user","content":"i have an algorithm that produces disparate sequences of data. it presently wraps a stringview generator (c++23 std::generator) and breaks the input based on delimiters or infixes. I'd like to engage the output of this algorithm as something iterable like a generator, but I'd like to engage each sequence between a delimiter separately. How can I do this? do ranges help? could i return multiple generators?","ts":1.738534367575E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"You can achieve this by creating a generator that yields other generators. This is often referred to as a \"generator of generators\" or \"nested generators.\" Here's a simplified example of how you can implement this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <generator>\n#include <string_view>\n#include <iostream>\n\nstd::generator<std::generator<std::string_view>> split_sequences(std::string_view input, std::string_view delimiter) {\n    size_t pos = 0;\n    while (true) {\n        size_t next_pos = input.find(delimiter, pos);\n        if (next_pos == std::string_view::npos) {\n            co_yield split_remaining(input.substr(pos));\n            break;\n        }\n        co_yield split_substring(input.substr(pos, next_pos - pos));\n        pos = next_pos + delimiter.size();\n    }\n}\n\nstd::generator<std::string_view> split_substring(std::string_view input) {\n    // Your existing algorithm to split the substring\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < input.size(); ++i) {\n        co_yield input.substr(i, 1);\n    }\n}\n\nstd::generator<std::string_view> split_remaining(std::string_view input) {\n    // Your existing algorithm to split the remaining string\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < input.size(); ++i) {\n        co_yield input.substr(i, 1);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string input = \"hello,world,abc,def\";\n    std::string delimiter = \",\";\n    for (auto sequence : split_sequences(input, delimiter)) {\n        std::cout << \"Sequence: \";\n        for (auto element : sequence) {\n            std::cout << element << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `split_sequences` is a generator that yields other generators. Each inner generator represents a sequence of data between delimiters.\n\nAs for using ranges, you can use the `std::ranges` library to create a range that represents the sequences of data. However, this would require creating a custom range class that knows how to iterate over the sequences.\n\nReturning multiple generators is essentially what the \"generator of generators\" approach does. You're returning a single generator that yields multiple inner generators, each representing a sequence of data.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified example, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific use case. You may need to modify the `split_substring` and `split_remaining` functions to match your existing algorithm.","ts":1.73853438866E9}
{"role":"user","content":"some words have a form ending in \"ion\" .. like approximation for approximate, but for other words when you're doing it it ends in \"ing\", like running for run, or also just plain \"run\". Like, this is our approximation approach, this is our running approach, this our run ... You can do this to a lot of words, like if you are turning something into fluid you could invent the word fluidation to talk about the process. But some words you can't put 'ion' on? I want to add 'ion' to 'delimit' but it doesn't seem to work","ts":1.738535787295E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"You're exploring the world of word formation and morphology.\n\nIn English, the suffix \"-ion\" is often used to form nouns that denote a process, state, or result of an action. This is called a \"nominalization\" or \"derivational suffix.\" Examples include:\n\n* action → action\n* educate → education\n* approximate → approximation\n\nHowever, not all verbs can be nominalized with the \"-ion\" suffix. The reason is that English has a complex system of word formation, and different verbs follow different patterns.\n\nIn the case of \"delimit,\" the correct nominalization is actually \"delimitation.\" This is because \"delimit\" comes from the Latin \"delimitare,\" which is a combination of \"de\" (meaning \"from\" or \"away\") and \"limitare\" (meaning \"to limit\"). The Latin nominalization of \"delimitare\" is \"delimitatio,\" which has been borrowed into English as \"delimitation.\"\n\nSo, to answer your question, you can indeed add \"-ion\" to \"delimit,\" but the correct result is \"delimitation,\" not \"delimition.\"\n\nAs for why some words can't be nominalized with \"-ion,\" it's often because they follow different patterns or have different etymologies. For example:\n\n* run → running (using the \"-ing\" suffix to form a gerund or present participle)\n* turn → turning (similar to \"run\")\n* fluid → fluidization (using the \"-ization\" suffix, which is a different nominalization pattern)\n\nInventing new words by adding suffixes can be a fun and creative process, but it's essential to be aware of the underlying patterns and rules of word formation to ensure that your creations are grammatically correct and easy to understand.","ts":1.738535799918E9}
{"role":"user","content":"so saying \"this is my delimiting\" vs \"this is my delimitation\" are different?","ts":1.738535850034E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, \"this is my delimiting\" and \"this is my delimitation\" have different meanings and connotations.\n\n**Delimiting** (using the \"-ing\" suffix) is a present participle or a gerund, which typically refers to the act or process of delimiting something. It can also imply an ongoing or continuous action.\n\nExample sentences:\n\n* \"Delimiting the boundaries of the project is a challenging task.\" (Here, \"delimiting\" refers to the process of defining the project's boundaries.)\n* \"I'm delimiting the scope of the research to focus on the most critical aspects.\" (Here, \"delimiting\" implies an ongoing action of narrowing down the research scope.)\n\n**Delimitation** (using the \"-ion\" suffix) is a noun that refers to the result or outcome of delimiting something. It can also imply a completed or defined state.\n\nExample sentences:\n\n* \"The delimitation of the project boundaries was a crucial step in its success.\" (Here, \"delimitation\" refers to the result of defining the project's boundaries.)\n* \"The new policy establishes a clear delimitation between the company's responsibilities and those of its partners.\" (Here, \"delimitation\" implies a defined state or a clear distinction.)\n\nIn general, if you're referring to the process or act of delimiting something, \"delimiting\" might be a better choice. If you're referring to the result or outcome of delimiting something, \"delimitation\" might be more suitable.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the distinction between these two forms can be subtle, and the choice ultimately depends on the context and the intended meaning.","ts":1.738535858529E9}
