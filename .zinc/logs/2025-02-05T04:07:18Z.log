{"role":"user","content":"Can you give me a bash script to copy stdin to stderr until a line starting with ``` is encountered, then send content to stdout until a line consisting only of ``` is encountered, and then copy back to stderr again? i'm trying to extract code from messages that have it surrounded in triple-backticks.","ts":1.738728500817E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Here's a bash script that accomplishes what you're asking for:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nstate=\"stderr\"\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n  if [ \"$state\" = \"stderr\" ] && [[ \"$line\" =~ ^\\`\\`\\` ]]; then\n    state=\"stdout\"\n  elif [ \"$state\" = \"stdout\" ] && [ \"$line\" = \"\\`\\`\\`\" ]; then\n    state=\"stderr\"\n  fi\n\n  if [ \"$state\" = \"stderr\" ]; then\n    echo \"$line\" >&2\n  else\n    echo \"$line\"\n  fi\ndone\n```\n\nLet me explain how this script works:\n\n- It starts in a state where it copies lines to stderr.\n- When it encounters a line starting with triple backticks, it switches to copying lines to stdout.\n- When it encounters a line consisting only of triple backticks while in the stdout state, it switches back to copying lines to stderr.\n- The `IFS=` and `-r` options to `read` ensure that the line is read exactly as it is, without any word splitting or backslash interpretation.\n- The `>&2` redirection sends output to stderr.\n\nYou can use this script in a pipeline like this:\n\n```bash\n./script.sh < input.txt\n```\n\nReplace `./script.sh` with the name of the script file, and `input.txt` with the name of the file containing the input data. The script will print the extracted code to stdout and the rest of the input to stderr.","ts":1.738728519472E9}
