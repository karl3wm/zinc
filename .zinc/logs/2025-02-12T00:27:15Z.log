{"role":"assistant","content":"In Vim, you can wrap a long multiline C string using the `gq` command, which is used to format text. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Wrap a Long Multiline C String\n\n1. **Enter Visual Mode**:\n   - Move the cursor to the start of the string.\n   - Press `V` to enter Visual Line mode (or `v` for Visual mode if you want to select a portion of the string).\n\n2. **Select the String**:\n   - Use `j` or `k` to select the lines that contain the string.\n\n3. **Wrap the String**:\n   - Press `gq`. This will wrap the selected text according to the `textwidth` setting (default is 80 characters).\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have the following C string:\n\n```c\nchar *str = \"This is a very long string that spans multiple lines \"\n            \"and needs to be wrapped to fit within a certain width.\";\n```\n\nTo wrap this string:\n\n1. Move the cursor to the start of the string.\n2. Press `V` to enter Visual Line mode.\n3. Select the lines containing the string.\n4. Press `gq`.\n\n### Customizing Wrap Width\n\nYou can set the `textwidth` to a specific value to control the wrapping width. For example, to set it to 60 characters:\n\n```vim\n:set textwidth=60\n```\n\n### Using `:set wrap` and `:set linebreak`\n\nIf you want Vim to visually wrap long lines without inserting line breaks, you can use:\n\n```vim\n:set wrap\n:set linebreak\n```\n\nThis will visually wrap the text at the window edge or at word boundaries, but it won't actually modify the file.\n\n### Using `:set formatoptions`\n\nFor C strings, you might want to ensure that Vim doesn't break the string in the middle of a word. You can set `formatoptions` to include `l`:\n\n```vim\n:set formatoptions+=l\n```\n\nThis will prevent Vim from breaking lines in the middle of a word.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Wrap using `gq` in Visual mode**.\n- **Set `textwidth` to control the wrap width**.\n- **Use `:set wrap` and `:set linebreak` for visual wrapping without modifying the file**.\n\nThis should help you wrap long multiline C strings in Vim effectively!","ts":1.739338075864E9}
