{"role":"assistant","content":"In CMake, `add_subdirectory` is a command that allows you to include a subdirectory in your build process. When you call `add_subdirectory`, CMake will:\n\n1. Enter the specified subdirectory.\n2. Read the `CMakeLists.txt` file in that subdirectory.\n3. Process the commands in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.\n4. Add any targets (e.g., libraries, executables) defined in the subdirectory to the build.\n\nThe syntax for `add_subdirectory` is:\n```cmake\nadd_subdirectory(subdir [binary_dir] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])\n```\nHere:\n\n* `subdir` is the name of the subdirectory to include.\n* `binary_dir` is an optional argument that specifies the directory where the binary files for the subdirectory will be built. If not specified, it defaults to the same directory as the source files.\n* `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` is an optional argument that tells CMake not to include the targets from the subdirectory in the `ALL` target (i.e., the default target that builds everything).\n\nExample:\n```cmake\n# Top-level CMakeLists.txt\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\nproject(MyProject)\n\nadd_subdirectory(src)\nadd_subdirectory(tests)\n```\n\n```cmake\n# src/CMakeLists.txt\nadd_library(mylib mylib.cpp)\n```\n\n```cmake\n# tests/CMakeLists.txt\nadd_executable(mytest mytest.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(mytest mylib)\n```\nIn this example, the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file includes the `src` and `tests` subdirectories using `add_subdirectory`. The `src` subdirectory defines a library target `mylib`, and the `tests` subdirectory defines an executable target `mytest` that links against `mylib`. When you run CMake, it will process the commands in all three `CMakeLists.txt` files and generate a build system that includes all the targets.","ts":1.738867203335E9}
