{"role":"assistant","content":"You're looking for a way to decouple your data interface from the specific backend implementations, while also allowing for runtime introspection. Here are some options you might consider:\n\n1. **Use a meta-programming library**: Boost has a few libraries that can help with meta-programming, such as Boost.MPL, Boost.TypeTraits, and Boost.Hana. However, since you don't want to expose Boost in your class headers, you might consider using a standard library alternative like `std::meta` (C++20) or a lightweight, header-only meta-programming library like `metal`.\n2. **Implement a reflection system**: You can create a custom reflection system using C++20's `std::source_location` and `std::string_view` to store metadata about your classes. This would require some boilerplate code, but it would allow you to introspect your classes at runtime.\n3. **Use a serialization library**: Libraries like `cereal` or `nlohmann/json` provide serialization and deserialization capabilities that can be used to introspect your classes. These libraries often use SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) to detect the presence of certain members or functions in your classes.\n4. **Leverage `std::any` and `std::variant`**: C++17 introduced `std::any` and `std::variant`, which can be used to store and manipulate values of different types. You could use these classes to create a type-erased interface for your data backend.\n5. **Create a custom traits system**: You can define a set of traits that describe the properties of your classes, such as the presence of certain members or functions. This would require some boilerplate code, but it would allow you to introspect your classes at compile-time.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's an example of how you might implement a simple reflection system using C++20's `std::source_location` and `std::string_view`:\n```cpp\n// reflection.hpp\n#ifndef REFLECTION_HPP\n#define REFLECTION_HPP\n\n#include <source_location>\n#include <string_view>\n#include <vector>\n\nnamespace reflection {\n\nstruct Member {\n    std::string_view name;\n    std::source_location location;\n};\n\nclass Reflectable {\npublic:\n    virtual ~Reflectable() = default;\n    virtual std::vector<Member> getMembers() const = 0;\n};\n\n} // namespace reflection\n\n#endif // REFLECTION_HPP\n```\n\n```cpp\n// my_class.hpp\n#ifndef MY_CLASS_HPP\n#define MY_CLASS_HPP\n\n#include \"reflection.hpp\"\n\nclass MyClass : public reflection::Reflectable {\npublic:\n    MyClass(int x, int y) : x_(x), y_(y) {}\n\n    std::vector<reflection::Member> getMembers() const override {\n        return {\n            {\"x\", std::source_location::current()},\n            {\"y\", std::source_location::current()}\n        };\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    int x_;\n    int y_;\n};\n\n#endif // MY_CLASS_HPP\n```\nThis is just a simple example, but it demonstrates the idea of using a reflection system to introspect your classes. You can then use this information to serialize or deserialize your classes to/from different data backends.\n\nFor the data backend, you can create a separate interface that takes a `Reflectable` object as an argument, and uses the reflection information to serialize or deserialize the object. For example:\n```cpp\n// data_backend.hpp\n#ifndef DATA_BACKEND_HPP\n#define DATA_BACKEND_HPP\n\n#include \"reflection.hpp\"\n\nnamespace data_backend {\n\nclass DataBackend {\npublic:\n    virtual ~DataBackend() = default;\n    virtual void serialize(const reflection::Reflectable& obj) = 0;\n    virtual void deserialize(reflection::Reflectable& obj) = 0;\n};\n\n} // namespace data_backend\n\n#endif // DATA_BACKEND_HPP\n```\nYou can then implement different data backends (e.g., INI, JSON, SQLite) that inherit from this interface and use the reflection information to serialize or deserialize the objects.\n\nI hope this gives you some ideas for how to approach this problem! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more guidance.","ts":1738262457.328}
