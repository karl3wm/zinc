{"role":"assistant","content":"In general, it's not a good idea to put a C function in a header file that is included in multiple compilation units. Here's why:\n\nWhen you include a header file in multiple compilation units, the contents of the header file are essentially copied into each compilation unit. If the header file contains a function definition, you'll end up with multiple definitions of the same function, one in each compilation unit. This will cause a linking error, because the linker will see multiple definitions of the same function and won't know which one to use.\n\nHowever, there are a few ways to avoid this problem:\n\n1. **Use inline functions**: If you declare a function as `inline`, you can put it in a header file without causing linking problems. This is because `inline` functions are essentially expanded in-place, so each compilation unit will get its own copy of the function. However, be aware that this can increase the size of your binary.\n\n```c\n// my_header.h\ninline int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use static functions**: If you declare a function as `static`, it will have internal linkage, meaning that each compilation unit will get its own private copy of the function. This can be useful if you want to provide a helper function that's only used within a single compilation unit.\n\n```c\n// my_header.h\nstatic int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, be aware that using `static` functions in header files can lead to code duplication, since each compilation unit will get its own copy of the function.\n\n3. **Use a separate source file**: The best way to avoid linking problems is to put your function definitions in a separate source file (e.g., `my_functions.c`) and only declare the functions in the header file (e.g., `my_functions.h`). This way, you can include the header file in multiple compilation units without causing linking problems.\n\n```c\n// my_functions.h\nint add(int a, int b);\n\n// my_functions.c\nint add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, while it's technically possible to put a C function in a header file that's included in multiple compilation units, it's generally not a good idea. Instead, use inline functions, static functions, or separate source files to avoid linking problems.","ts":1.738606221526E9}
