It had (a) a helper to access a statically-allocated user configuration directory. this used a local struct with a constructor function that found a good path for user configuration files and appended .zinc to it. (b) a helper that took a reference to a statically-allocated thread-local filesystem path, added a list of subdirectories, and returned .native() cast as a string_view. (c) the init() function called the path_local() function with no arguments, and if there was an exception thrown, it generated a .zinc folder in the current directory. (d) the path_local() function had a statically allocated path for the root local configuration directory, initially empty. it opened a locked scope and tested if this was empty, and if it was it iterated parent paths from the current directory. for each path, it considered a .zinc subfolder for hte path. if this subfolder was the same as the user configuration directory, it broke the loop. if it existed, then it assigned to the static variable and break the loop. after the loop it checked if this variable was still empty and threw the exception if it was. (e) then the end of both path_local() and path_user() (i might have the function names wrong, saying from memory) would call the second helper to return their value, returning a reference to the storage held by thread local static paths allocated by the caller.\n\n**include/zinc/configuration.hpp**\n```\n#pragma once\n\n#include <zinc/common.hpp>\n\n#include <span>\n#include <string_view>\n\nnamespace zinc {\n\nclass Configuration {\npublic:\n    /*\n     * Create the configuration directories if they don't exist.\n     *\n     * Returns true if new directories were created.\n     */\n    static bool init();\n\n    /*\n     * Get a per-project configuration path.\n     */\n    static std::string_view path_local(std::span<std::string_view> subpaths = {}, bool is_dir = false);\n\n    /*\n     * Get a per-user configuration path.\n     */\n    static std::string_view path_user(std::span<std::string_view> subpaths = {}, bool is_dir = false);\n};\n\n}\n```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n","ts":1.73836932553E9}
