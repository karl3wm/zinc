{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, I'm familiar with edlib. Edlib is a lightweight, open-source library for computing edit distances and alignments between sequences. Here's a basic adapter for edlib that should be compatible with the diff-match-patch library:\n\n```python\nimport edlib\n\nclass EdlibAdapter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def diff_main(self, a, b):\n        result = edlib.align(a, b, mode=\"NW\")\n        return self._parse_edlib_result(result, a, b)\n\n    def _parse_edlib_result(self, result, a, b):\n        operations = []\n        a_idx = 0\n        b_idx = 0\n        for op in result[\"cigar\"]:\n            if op == \"=\":\n                operations.append((0, a[a_idx]))\n                a_idx += 1\n                b_idx += 1\n            elif op == \"I\":\n                operations.append((1, b[b_idx]))\n                b_idx += 1\n            elif op == \"D\":\n                operations.append((-1, a[a_idx]))\n                a_idx += 1\n        return operations\n\n    def diff_cleanupSemantic(self, diffs):\n        # This function is not directly applicable to edlib's output.\n        # It's intended to convert the output to a more human-readable format.\n        # You might need to adjust this function according to your needs.\n        return diffs\n\n    def diff_prettyText(self, diffs):\n        # This function is not directly applicable to edlib's output.\n        # It's intended to convert the output to a more human-readable format.\n        # You might need to adjust this function according to your needs.\n        result = \"\"\n        for op, text in diffs:\n            if op == 0:\n                result += \"  \" + text\n            elif op == 1:\n                result += \"+ \" + text\n            elif op == -1:\n                result += \"- \" + text\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nadapter = EdlibAdapter()\na = \"kitten\"\nb = \"sitting\"\ndiffs = adapter.diff_main(a, b)\nprint(adapter.diff_prettyText(diffs))\n```\n\nThis adapter provides the basic functionality of computing the edit distance and alignment between two sequences using edlib, and then converting the result into a format compatible with the diff-match-patch library.\n\nPlease note that the `diff_cleanupSemantic` and `diff_prettyText` functions are not directly applicable to edlib's output, and you might need to adjust them according to your needs.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is a basic adapter and might not cover all edge cases or provide the exact same functionality as the original diff-match-patch library.","ts":1.738815992345E9}
