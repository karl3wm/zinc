{"role":"assistant","content":"The issue lies in the fact that the word \"updated\" is not being matched because of the order of the alternatives in the regular expression.\n\nIn the regex `^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:|modified\\ |updated\\ )`, the empty string `|` is matched first, so the regex engine doesn't bother to check the rest of the alternatives. This means that the word \"updated\" is not being matched.\n\nTo fix this, you should reorder the alternatives so that the empty string is last:\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$line\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ |)\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]]\n```\n\nHowever, this will still match lines that don't have any of the words \"modified\" or \"updated\". If you want to match only lines that have one of these words, you should remove the empty string alternative:\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$line\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ )\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]]\n```\n\nIf you want to make the word optional, but still match the backtick-enclosed filename, you can use:\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$line\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ )?\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]]\n```\n\nThe `?` after the non-capturing group `(?:...)` makes it optional.","ts":1.738876861461E9}
{"role":"user","content":"usually regexps don't seem to care about possibilities that don't match ...?","ts":1.738876919201E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"In regular expressions, the order of alternatives usually doesn't matter, because the regex engine will try all possibilities until it finds a match.\n\nThe issue in this case is likely due to the fact that the empty string `|` is matching the space after \"the\", so the regex engine is not trying to match the rest of the alternatives.\n\nHowever, this is not the main issue here. The main issue is that the regex engine is matching the empty string `|` and then trying to match the backtick, which is succeeding because the backtick is present in the string.\n\nThe correct explanation is that the regex engine is matching the string \"Here is the `...\" and the empty string alternative is allowing it to skip the \"updated\" part.\n\nTo fix this, you should remove the empty string alternative or make the word optional as I mentioned in my previous response:\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$line\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ )\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]]\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$line\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ )?\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]]\n```","ts":1.738876930952E9}

{"role":"assistant","content":"The issue is indeed with the `?:` operator.\n\nIn Bash, the `?:` operator is used to create a non-capturing group in a regular expression. However, it seems that Bash's regex engine has a bug or limitation when using non-capturing groups with the `=~` operator.\n\nWhen you use a non-capturing group with `?:`, the regex engine is not able to match the pattern correctly. This is why removing the `?:` operator fixes the issue.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```bash\n# With non-capturing group (does not match)\n[[ \"Here is the updated `man/split_plan.txt` file:\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (?:modified\\ |updated\\ )\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]] && echo \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"\n\n# Without non-capturing group (matches)\n[[ \"Here is the updated `man/split_plan.txt` file:\" =~ ^Here\\ is\\ the\\ (modified\\ |updated\\ )\\`([^\\`]+)\\` ]] && echo \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"\n```\n\nIn the second example, the parentheses create a capturing group, which allows the regex engine to match the pattern correctly.\n\nIt's worth noting that this issue is specific to Bash's regex engine, and other regex engines (such as those used in Perl or Python) do not have this limitation.","ts":1.738877209554E9}
