{"role":"assistant","content":"When you run `:term ++shell ./chat` in Neovim, it opens a terminal buffer where you can interact with the shell. However, by default, the terminal buffer is in insert mode, and you can't use normal-mode commands directly.\n\nTo use normal-mode commands like scrolling the window up or splitting the window, you need to press `Ctrl + \\` (or `Ctrl + [` on some systems) to exit the terminal's insert mode and enter normal mode. This will allow you to use Neovim's normal-mode commands.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* Scroll the window up: `Ctrl + \\` then `k` or `Ctrl + u`\n* Scroll the window down: `Ctrl + \\` then `j` or `Ctrl + d`\n* Split the window vertically: `Ctrl + \\` then `:vsplit`\n* Split the window horizontally: `Ctrl + \\` then `:split`\n\nNote that when you press `Ctrl + \\`, you will be in normal mode, and you can use all the normal-mode commands. To go back to the terminal's insert mode, simply press `i` or `a`.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `:tnoremap` command to map certain keys to exit the terminal's insert mode and enter normal mode. For example:\n```vim\n:tnoremap <Esc> <C-\\><C-n>\n```\nThis will map the `Esc` key to exit the terminal's insert mode and enter normal mode.","ts":1738222591.633}
