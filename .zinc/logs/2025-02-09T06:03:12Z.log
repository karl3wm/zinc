{"role":"user","content":"I'm thinking of augmenting boost::json basic_parser and/or a handler or such to track the character ranges represented by values. I'm noting that the character ranges during parsing are held by const char * pointers that are passed into parse functions as a parameter, and returned updated from those functions. Given basic_parser is templated, could I specialize the template in such a way that I can change the parse_value function to track its character pointer?","ts":1.739099102501E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can specialize the `basic_parser` template to modify its behavior. However, since `basic_parser` is a class template, you would need to specialize the entire class, which might be cumbersome.\n\nA more feasible approach would be to create a custom handler that inherits from `boost::json::handler` and overrides the `on_string_part`, `on_int64`, `on_uint64`, `on_double`, etc. member functions to track the character ranges.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you could implement this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <boost/json.hpp>\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass range_handler : public boost::json::handler\n{\npublic:\n    range_handler() : start_(nullptr), end_(nullptr) {}\n\n    bool on_document_begin(boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        start_ = nullptr;\n        end_ = nullptr;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_string_part(boost::json::string_view const& sv, boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        if (!start_)\n        {\n            start_ = sv.data();\n        }\n        end_ = sv.data() + sv.size();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_int64(int64_t i, boost::json::string_view const& sv, boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        if (!start_)\n        {\n            start_ = sv.data();\n        }\n        end_ = sv.data() + sv.size();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_uint64(uint64_t u, boost::json::string_view const& sv, boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        if (!start_)\n        {\n            start_ = sv.data();\n        }\n        end_ = sv.data() + sv.size();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_double(double d, boost::json::string_view const& sv, boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        if (!start_)\n        {\n            start_ = sv.data();\n        }\n        end_ = sv.data() + sv.size();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_bool(bool b, boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        // bool values are not associated with a specific character range\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    bool on_null(boost::json::error_code& ec) override\n    {\n        // null values are not associated with a specific character range\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    const char* get_start() const { return start_; }\n    const char* get_end() const { return end_; }\n\nprivate:\n    const char* start_;\n    const char* end_;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    const char* json = \"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"value\\\"}\";\n    range_handler handler;\n    boost::json::parser parser;\n    parser.write(json, handler);\n    std::cout << \"Start: \" << handler.get_start() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"End: \" << handler.get_end() << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a custom handler that tracks the character ranges of string values. You can extend this approach to track the ranges of other types of values as well.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified example and might not cover all edge cases. You may need to modify the handler to suit your specific requirements.\n\nAs for specializing the `basic_parser` template, it's possible but more complicated. You would need to specialize the entire class template, which would involve redefining all its member functions. This approach is generally not recommended unless you have a very specific use case that cannot be achieved through other means.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace boost {\nnamespace json {\n\ntemplate <>\nclass basic_parser<my_handler>\n{\n    // redefine all member functions\n};\n\n} // namespace json\n} // namespace boost\n```\n\nThis approach requires a deep understanding of the `basic_parser` class template and its interactions with the handler. It's generally recommended to use a custom handler instead, as shown in the example above.","ts":1.739099109857E9}
{"role":"user","content":"could I avoid the need to specialize all member functions by having the template inherit from a different specialization ... ?","ts":1.739099161529E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can avoid the need to specialize all member functions by having the template inherit from a different specialization. This is a common technique in C++ template metaprogramming, known as \"template inheritance\" or \"template subclassing\".\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this technique to specialize the `basic_parser` template:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace boost {\nnamespace json {\n\ntemplate <>\nclass basic_parser<my_handler> : public basic_parser<default_handler>\n{\n    // only redefine the member functions that need to be specialized\n    bool parse_value(my_handler& handler, boost::json::error_code& ec)\n    {\n        // custom implementation\n    }\n};\n\n} // namespace json\n} // namespace boost\n```\n\nIn this example, the `basic_parser<my_handler>` specialization inherits from the `basic_parser<default_handler>` specialization, which provides the default implementation for all member functions. The `basic_parser<my_handler>` specialization only needs to redefine the `parse_value` member function, which is the one that needs to be customized.\n\nBy using template inheritance, you can avoid the need to redefine all member functions, which makes the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the `basic_parser` template is designed to be inherited from, and that the member functions are virtual or can be overridden. If the `basic_parser` template is not designed for inheritance, you may need to use a different approach.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that template inheritance can lead to the \"diamond problem\" if not used carefully. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common base class, and the derived class ends up with multiple copies of the base class's members. To avoid this problem, you can use virtual inheritance or other techniques to ensure that the base class is only instantiated once.\n\nIn the case of the `basic_parser` template, it's likely that the designers of the Boost.JSON library have taken steps to ensure that the template can be safely inherited from, but it's always a good idea to double-check the documentation and the code to make sure.","ts":1.739099166152E9}
{"role":"user","content":"I'd need to be careful to copy in all functions that call member functions that call my own, so that mine get called instead of the parent's. basic_parser doesn't have any base classes other than itself.","ts":1.739099220122E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"In that case, you'll need to be careful to override all the functions that call `parse_value`, so that they call your overridden version instead of the parent's version.\n\nSince `basic_parser` doesn't have any base classes other than itself, you don't have to worry about the diamond problem. However, you'll still need to make sure that all the functions that call `parse_value` are overridden in your specialization, so that they call your version of `parse_value`.\n\nThis can be a bit tedious, but it's a necessary step to ensure that your overridden version of `parse_value` gets called correctly.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this:\n```cpp\nnamespace boost {\nnamespace json {\n\ntemplate <>\nclass basic_parser<my_handler> : public basic_parser<default_handler>\n{\n    // override parse_value\n    bool parse_value(my_handler& handler, boost::json::error_code& ec)\n    {\n        // custom implementation\n    }\n\n    // override parse_array\n    bool parse_array(my_handler& handler, boost::json::error_code& ec)\n    {\n        // call parse_value from this class, not the parent class\n        return parse_value(handler, ec);\n    }\n\n    // override parse_object\n    bool parse_object(my_handler& handler, boost::json::error_code& ec)\n    {\n        // call parse_value from this class, not the parent class\n        return parse_value(handler, ec);\n    }\n\n    // ... override other functions that call parse_value ...\n};\n\n} // namespace json\n} // namespace boost\n```\nBy overriding all the functions that call `parse_value`, you can ensure that your custom implementation of `parse_value` gets called correctly.\n\nIt's worth noting that this approach can be a bit fragile, since it relies on the internal implementation details of the `basic_parser` class. If the implementation of `basic_parser` changes in a future version of Boost.JSON, your overridden functions may no longer work correctly.\n\nHowever, if you need to customize the behavior of `basic_parser` and can't use a custom handler, this approach may be your best option. Just be sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.","ts":1.739099224464E9}
{"role":"user","content":"What about this approach: I could #define a macro that wraps parse_value so as to pass the character pointer to the handler.","ts":1.739099343393E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Using a macro to wrap the `parse_value` function is a clever approach. By defining a macro that wraps the `parse_value` function, you can modify the behavior of the function without having to override it or create a custom handler.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define such a macro:\n```cpp\n#define parse_value(handler, ec) \\\n    parse_value_impl(handler, ec, __FILE__, __LINE__, this->p_)\n```\nIn this example, the macro `parse_value` is defined to call a new function `parse_value_impl`, which takes the original arguments `handler` and `ec`, as well as the current file and line number, and the current character pointer `this->p_`.\n\nYou would then need to define the `parse_value_impl` function to call the original `parse_value` function, and also pass the character pointer to the handler:\n```cpp\nbool parse_value_impl(my_handler& handler, boost::json::error_code& ec, const char* file, int line, const char* p)\n{\n    handler.set_character_pointer(p);\n    return parse_value(handler, ec);\n}\n```\nBy using a macro to wrap the `parse_value` function, you can modify the behavior of the function without having to change the underlying code. This approach is often referred to as \"aspect-oriented programming\", where you're adding a new aspect (in this case, passing the character pointer to the handler) to the existing code without modifying it.\n\nThis approach has some advantages over the previous approaches:\n\n* It's less invasive, as you don't need to modify the underlying code or create a custom handler.\n* It's more flexible, as you can easily add or remove the macro definition as needed.\n* It's more reusable, as you can use the same macro definition in multiple places.\n\nHowever, it also has some potential drawbacks:\n\n* Macros can be tricky to debug, as the macro expansion can make it difficult to understand what's happening.\n* Macros can also lead to naming conflicts, if the macro name clashes with an existing function or variable name.\n\nOverall, using a macro to wrap the `parse_value` function is a clever approach that can be effective in certain situations. Just be sure to use it judiciously and with caution.","ts":1.739099348415E9}
