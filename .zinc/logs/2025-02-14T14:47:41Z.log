{"role":"assistant","content":"Language model providers often offer APIs with various parameters to control the behavior of the model during text generation. Whether or not there is a specific parameter to disable the skipping of special tokens depends on the provider and the API in question. Here’s a general overview of how major providers handle this:\n\n### 1. **OpenAI (GPT models)**\n   - OpenAI's API does not have a specific parameter to \"disable skipping of special tokens.\" However, you can control the output by adjusting parameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, and `max_tokens` to influence the generation process.\n   - Special tokens (e.g., `<|endoftext|>`) are typically handled internally, and the API will not skip them unless they are explicitly excluded by the context or generation logic.\n\n### 2. **Hugging Face (Transformers)**\n   - Hugging Face’s `transformers` library provides more granular control over tokenization and generation. When using their models, you can configure the tokenizer and generation process to handle special tokens explicitly.\n   - Parameters like `skip_special_tokens` (in the `.decode()` method) allow you to control whether special tokens are included or excluded in the output. Setting `skip_special_tokens=False` will include special tokens in the generated text.\n\n### 3. **Google Cloud (Vertex AI, PaLM)**\n   - Google’s APIs for language models, such as Vertex AI or PaLM, may not have a specific parameter to disable skipping special tokens. However, you can often influence the output by adjusting parameters like `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`.\n   - Special tokens are typically managed internally, and their inclusion or exclusion is determined by the model’s training and the API’s default behavior.\n\n### 4. **Cohere**\n   - Cohere’s API provides parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `stop_sequences` to control text generation. There is no explicit parameter to disable skipping special tokens, but you can manage the output by crafting prompts and adjusting the available parameters.\n\n### Summary\nIf you need precise control over the inclusion or exclusion of special tokens, Hugging Face’s `transformers` library is currently the most flexible, as it allows you to explicitly set `skip_special_tokens=False`. For other providers, you may need to work within their API constraints or preprocess/postprocess the text to handle special tokens as needed.

{"role":"assistant","content":"vLLM (a high-performance and memory-efficient library for LLM inference) is designed for fast and efficient serving of large language models. It supports features like PagedAttention and optimized GPU utilization. When it comes to handling special tokens, here’s how vLLM approaches it:\n\n### Special Tokens in vLLM\nvLLM is built on top of the Hugging Face `transformers` library, so it inherits many of its tokenization and decoding behaviors. By default, special tokens (e.g., `<s>`, `</s>`, `[PAD]`, etc.) are included in the tokenizer's vocabulary and are handled during tokenization and decoding.\n\n### Controlling Special Tokens in vLLM\nvLLM provides a `SamplingParams` class to configure the generation process. While it doesn’t have a dedicated parameter for \"disabling skipping of special tokens,\" you can control the inclusion of special tokens through the tokenizer and decoding process.\n\n#### Key Points:\n1. **Tokenizer Behavior**:\n   - The tokenizer used by vLLM (e.g., from Hugging Face) can be configured to include or exclude special tokens during tokenization and decoding.\n   - For example, when calling the tokenizer’s `.decode()` method, you can pass `skip_special_tokens=False` to ensure special tokens are included in the output.\n\n2. **SamplingParams**:\n   - vLLM’s `SamplingParams` allows you to configure generation settings like `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `max_tokens`. While it doesn’t directly control special tokens, these parameters influence the generation process.\n\n3. **Custom Output Handling**:\n   - If you want to ensure special tokens are included in the output, you can post-process the generated text using the tokenizer’s `.decode()` method with `skip_special_tokens=False`.\n\n### Example Workflow\nHere’s an example of how you might handle special tokens with vLLM:\n\n```python\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\n# Initialize the tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"your-model-name\")\n\n# Initialize vLLM\nllm = LLM(model=\"your-model-name\")\n\n# Set sampling parameters\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=50)\n\n# Generate text\nprompt = \"Your input prompt here\"\n","finish_reason":"{\"text\":\"\\\"\\n\",\"logprobs\":{\"token_logprobs\":[-6.30296990275383E-2],\"tokens\":[\"token_id:2701\"]},\"token_ids\":[2701]}","ts":1.739562604935E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"outputs = llm.generate(prompt, sampling_params)\n\n# Decode the output, ensuring special tokens are included\nfor output in outputs:\n    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(\n        output.token_ids, skip_special_tokens=False\n    )\n    print(generated_text)\n```\n\n### Summary\nvLLM itself doesn’t have a specific API parameter to disable skipping special tokens, but you can achieve this by configuring the tokenizer (e.g., using `skip_special_tokens=False` in the `.decode()` method). Since vLLM is tightly integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem, you can leverage the same tokenization and decoding tools to control how special tokens are handled.\n\nFor the latest updates or specific features, always refer to the [vLLM documentation](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or the Hugging Face `transformers` library documentation.","finish_reason":"stop","ts":1.739562611836E9}
