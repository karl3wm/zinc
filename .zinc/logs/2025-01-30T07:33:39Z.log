{"role":"assistant","content":"When you run a terminal inside Vim using `:term`, you're essentially creating a new terminal buffer that allows you to interact with the shell. However, this terminal buffer doesn't behave like a regular Vim buffer, and you can't directly type Vim commands like `:vsplit` inside it.\n\nTo execute Vim commands while inside the terminal buffer, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Use the `Ctrl+W` key combination**: As you've discovered, you can use `Ctrl+W` to switch to the Vim command line, where you can type commands like `:vsplit`. This is a good way to execute one-off commands.\n2. **Use the `Ctrl+\\ Ctrl+N` key combination**: This will temporarily exit the terminal mode and allow you to type Vim commands. When you're done, you can press `i` to return to the terminal mode.\n3. **Create a new Vim window**: You can create a new Vim window using `Ctrl+W N` (or `Ctrl+W S` for a horizontal split). This will create a new window where you can type Vim commands without leaving the terminal buffer.\n4. **Use Vim's terminal mode mappings**: You can define custom mappings for the terminal mode using the `tnoremap` command. For example, you could map a key to execute a specific Vim command. However, this requires some configuration and might not be suitable for ad-hoc commands.\n\nTo make your life easier, you can also consider using Vim's built-in `:terminal` command with the `++close` option, like this:\n```\n:terminal ++close ./chat\n```\nThis will run the `./chat` command in a new terminal buffer and automatically close the buffer when the command finishes. This way, you can avoid having to manually switch between the terminal buffer and the Vim command line.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","ts":1738222475.352}
