{"role":"assistant","content":"When you're running a program under GDB and you press `^C` (Ctrl+C), GDB intercepts the signal (SIGINT) by default and stops the program execution, allowing you to debug it. However, if you want to let the `^C` signal propagate to the program being debugged (so that the program's own signal handler can handle it), you can do the following:\n\n### Method 1: Use the `signal` Command in GDB\nWhile your program is stopped in GDB, you can tell GDB to pass the signal to the program using the `signal` command:\n\n```gdb\n(gdb) signal SIGINT\n```\n\nThis command will send the SIGINT signal to the program, allowing its own signal handler to process it.\n\n### Method 2: Use `handle` Command to Change Signal Handling\nYou can configure GDB to pass the SIGINT signal to the program by default using the `handle` command:\n\n```gdb\n(gdb) handle SIGINT pass\n```\n\nThis tells GDB to pass the SIGINT signal to the program instead of intercepting it.
