{"role":"assistant","content":"The sequence you're referring to is called the sequence of Triangular Numbers.\n\nThe nth triangular number is the sum of the first n natural numbers. The sequence starts like this:\n\n0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...\n\nThe expression for the nth triangular number is given by the formula:\n\nTn = n*(n+1)/2\n\nwhere Tn is the nth triangular number and n is the index (starting from 0).\n\nHere's how the formula works for the first few triangular numbers:\n\n- T0 = 0*(0+1)/2 = 0\n- T1 = 1*(1+1)/2 = 1\n- T2 = 2*(2+1)/2 = 3\n- T3 = 3*(3+1)/2 = 6\n- T4 = 4*(4+1)/2 = 10\n- T5 = 5*(5+1)/2 = 15\n- T6 = 6*(6+1)/2 = 21\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn many programming languages, you can calculate the nth triangular number using a simple function like this:\n\n```python\ndef triangular_number(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth triangular number. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.","ts":1.738769230482E9}
