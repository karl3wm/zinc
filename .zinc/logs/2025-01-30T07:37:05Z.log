{"role":"assistant","content":"When you run `:term ++shell ./chat` in Vim, it opens a new terminal window within Vim and runs your `./chat` command. However, once the command finishes executing, the terminal buffer becomes non-modifiable, and you can't enter insert mode.\n\nIf you want to interact with your `./chat` command, you should prevent it from exiting immediately. Here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. **Run your command in a way that keeps it running**: If your `./chat` command is a server or a program that can run indefinitely, you can run it with a flag or option that keeps it running. For example, if it's a server, you might run it with a flag like `--no-daemon` or `--foreground`.\n\n2. **Use `:term` without the `++shell` option**: Instead of running `:term ++shell ./chat`, try running `:term ./chat`. This will open a new terminal window within Vim and run your `./chat` command, but it won't exit the shell when the command finishes. You'll be left with a shell prompt where you can interact with your command's output or run new commands.\n\n3. **Run a shell after your command**: You can run `:term ++shell ./chat; bash` (or replace `bash` with your preferred shell). This will run your `./chat` command and then start a new shell, allowing you to interact with the terminal buffer.\n\nIn any case, once you've started a terminal buffer that's running a command or shell, you can enter insert mode by pressing `i` or `a`, and you can exit insert mode by pressing `Ctrl + \\` (or `Ctrl + [`, depending on your Vim configuration).\n\nIf you see `[finished]` in the bottom bar, it means the command has exited, and you won't be able to interact with the terminal buffer. If you see `[running]`, it means the command is still running, and you can interact with the terminal buffer.","ts":1738222687.391}
{"role":"user","content":"ok ... i think i have to hit ^\\ ^n. i think if i just hit ^\\ then other keys i hit after that can terminate the command. it's a long-running command.","ts":1738222779.268}
{"role":"assistant","content":"When you're in a terminal buffer in Vim, hitting `Ctrl + \\` (also denoted as `^\\`) will exit insert mode, but it won't necessarily put you in normal mode. Instead, it will put you in a special mode called \"terminal normal mode\".\n\nIn terminal normal mode, many keys will be sent to the terminal instead of being interpreted by Vim. This is why hitting other keys after `^\\` can terminate the command or send unexpected input to the terminal.\n\nTo get to normal mode, where you can use Vim commands without sending input to the terminal, you need to hit `^\\` followed by `Ctrl + N` (or `^\\ ^N`).\n\nSo, your workflow would be:\n\n1. Run `:term ++shell ./chat` to start the terminal buffer.\n2. Interact with your command as needed.\n3. When you want to exit insert mode and use Vim commands, hit `^\\ ^N`.\n4. You'll now be in normal mode, where you can use Vim commands without sending input to the terminal.\n5. To go back to insert mode and interact with the terminal, simply hit `i` or `a`.\n\nBy hitting `^\\ ^N`, you're ensuring that you're in normal mode, where you can safely use Vim commands without affecting the terminal buffer.","ts":1738222795.278}
{"role":"user","content":"how do make escape do that?","ts":1738222851.236}
{"role":"assistant","content":"To make the `Escape` key behave like `^\\ ^N` in a terminal buffer, you can add the following line to your Vim configuration file (usually `~/.vimrc`):\n\n```vim\ntnoremap <Esc> <C-\\><C-n>\n```\n\nThis line maps the `Escape` key to `^\\ ^N` in terminal normal mode (`tnoremap` stands for \"terminal normal mode remap\").\n\nWith this mapping, when you're in a terminal buffer and you hit the `Escape` key, it will exit insert mode and put you in normal mode, just like hitting `^\\ ^N`.\n\nNote that this mapping only applies to terminal buffers, so it won't affect the behavior of the `Escape` key in other types of buffers.","ts":1738222870.562}

{"role":"assistant","content":"Yeah, it can be a bit of a journey figuring out the intricacies of Vim's terminal mode.

{"role":"user","content":"oh hm the buffer doesn't update in normal mode? i have to go to insert mode to see new output the command generated","ts":1738223045.133}
{"role":"assistant","content":"That's a known limitation of Vim's terminal mode. When you're in normal mode, the terminal buffer doesn't update in real-time. This is because Vim is designed to be a text editor, not a terminal emulator, and it doesn't have the ability to continuously update the buffer with new output.\n\nHowever, there is a workaround. You can use the `:redraw` command to manually update the terminal buffer while you're in normal mode. This will refresh the buffer and show you any new output that's been generated.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following command to enable automatic updating of the terminal buffer:\n\n```vim\nautocmd BufEnter term://* startinsert\n```\n\nThis will automatically put you in insert mode whenever you enter a terminal buffer, which will allow you to see new output in real-time. However, keep in mind that this will also make it more difficult to use normal mode commands in the terminal buffer.\n\nAnother option is to use the following command to update the terminal buffer periodically:\n\n```vim\nautocmd CursorHold term://* redraw!\n```\n\nThis will update the terminal buffer every time you stop moving the cursor for a short period of time (usually around 4 seconds). This can be a good compromise between being able to use normal mode commands and seeing new output in real-time.\n\nI hope one of these workarounds helps!","ts":1738223071.702}
