{"role":"user","content":"my userspace application seems completely unaware of when the server sends a FIN packet to my tcp stream. i'm curious about this. does the kernel do anything when a FIN packet is received, that userspace could identify?","ts":1738215506.855}
{"role":"assistant","content":"When a FIN packet is received by the kernel, it does indeed take action, but the visibility of this action to userspace applications depends on the specific socket API being used.\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. **Kernel's TCP stack processes the FIN packet**: When the kernel receives a FIN packet, it updates the TCP connection state to indicate that the remote peer has closed its end of the connection. This is typically done by transitioning the connection state from `ESTABLISHED` to `CLOSE_WAIT`.\n2. **Kernel notifies the socket**: The kernel notifies the socket associated with the TCP connection that the remote peer has closed its end of the connection. This notification is typically done by setting a flag on the socket, such as `EPOLLHUP` or `EPOLLRDHUP`, depending on the Linux kernel version and configuration.\n3. **Socket API notification**: The socket API used by your application determines how (or if) the kernel's notification is propagated to userspace. Here are a few common scenarios:\n	* **POSIX sockets (e.g., `socket()`, `connect()`, `read()`, `write()`)**: In this case, the kernel's notification is not directly visible to userspace. However, when your application attempts to read from the socket using `read()` or `recv()`, it will return 0 bytes, indicating that the remote peer has closed its end of the connection.\n	* **POSIX sockets with `select()` or `poll()`**: If your application uses `select()` or `poll()` to wait for events on the socket, the kernel's notification will be visible as a `POLLHUP` or `POLLRDHUP` event, respectively.\n	* **Linux-specific `epoll` API**: If your application uses the `epoll` API (e.g., `epoll_create()`, `epoll_ctl()`, `epoll_wait()`), the kernel's notification will be visible as an `EPOLLHUP` or `EPOLLRDHUP` event, depending on the Linux kernel version and configuration.\n\nTo detect the FIN packet in your userspace application, you can use one of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Use `select()` or `poll()`**: Register your socket with `select()` or `poll()` and wait for events. When the remote peer closes its end of the connection, your application will receive a `POLLHUP` or `POLLRDHUP` event.\n2. **Use `epoll` API**: If you're on a Linux system, you can use the `epoll` API to wait for events on your socket. When the remote peer closes its end of the connection, your application will receive an `EPOLLHUP` or `EPOLLRDHUP` event.\n3. **Check for 0-byte reads**: If you're using POSIX sockets, you can attempt to read from the socket using `read()` or `recv()`. If the remote peer has closed its end of the connection, the read operation will return 0 bytes.\n\nKeep in mind that the specific behavior and notification mechanisms may vary depending on the Linux kernel version, configuration, and socket API used.","ts":1738215516.983}
{"role":"user","content":"so, there's no data available to read from the socket until i send my next request, which is very large. i packet-logged this and my huge request was actually getting sent over the wire to a closed socket! can i use any of these approaches, preferably a more platform-independent one, to check if the connection has been closed without blocking?","ts":1738215625.909}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can use a platform-independent approach to check if the connection has been closed without blocking. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Use `recv()` with `MSG_PEEK` flag**: You can use the `recv()` function with the `MSG_PEEK` flag to check if there's any data available to read from the socket without removing it from the queue. If the connection has been closed, `recv()` will return 0 bytes.\n\n   ```c\nint bytesAvailable = recv(socket, buffer, 1, MSG_PEEK);\nif (bytesAvailable == 0) {\n    // Connection has been closed\n}\n```\n\n   Note that `MSG_PEEK` is a POSIX flag, but it's widely supported on most platforms.\n\n2. **Use `select()` with a zero timeout**: You can use the `select()` function with a zero timeout to check if the socket is readable without blocking. If the connection has been closed, the socket will be reported as readable.\n\n   ```c\nfd_set readSet;\nFD_ZERO(&readSet);\nFD_SET(socket, &readSet);\nstruct timeval timeout = {0, 0};\nint result = select(socket + 1, &readSet, NULL, NULL, &timeout);\nif (result > 0 && FD_ISSET(socket, &readSet)) {\n    // Socket is readable, check if connection has been closed\n    int bytesAvailable = recv(socket, buffer, 1, MSG_PEEK);\n    if (bytesAvailable == 0) {\n        // Connection has been closed\n    }\n}\n```\n\n   Note that `select()` is a POSIX function, but it's widely supported on most platforms.\n\n3. **Use `getsockopt()` with `SO_ERROR` option**: You can use the `getsockopt()` function with the `SO_ERROR` option to check if there's an error on the socket. If the connection has been closed, `getsockopt()` will return an error.\n\n   ```c\nint error = 0;\nsocklen_t errorLen = sizeof(error);\nint result = getsockopt(socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, &error, &errorLen);\nif (result == 0 && error != 0) {\n    // Connection has been closed\n}\n```\n\n   Note that `getsockopt()` is a POSIX function, but it's widely supported on most platforms.\n\nAll of these approaches are non-blocking and can be used to check if the connection has been closed before sending a large request. However, keep in mind that there's always a small window of time between checking the connection and sending the request, during which the connection could be closed. To minimize this window, you can use a combination of these approaches or use a more advanced socket API that provides better support for connection monitoring.","ts":1738215644.906}
{"role":"user","content":"i tried getsockopt SO_ERROR but it doesn't seem to detect the condition. hence my interest in what actual flags the kernel sets for a FIN packet (which has been received when i packetlog). the reading approaches, you say they detect availability of reading, but if no data has been received yet won't they return an incorrect result?","ts":1738215743.991}
{"role":"assistant","content":"You're correct that `getsockopt()` with `SO_ERROR` may not detect the condition of a received FIN packet.\n\nRegarding the reading approaches, you're right again. If no data has been received yet, `recv()` with `MSG_PEEK` or `select()` with a zero timeout may return an incorrect result, indicating that the socket is not readable or that there's no data available.\n\nWhen a FIN packet is received, the kernel sets the `EPOLLRDHUP` flag on the socket, which indicates that the remote peer has closed its end of the connection. However, this flag is not directly accessible through the POSIX socket API.\n\nOn Linux, you can use the `getsockopt()` function with the `TCP_INFO` option to retrieve information about the TCP connection, including the state of the connection. The `tcp_info` structure returned by this function contains a field called `tcpi_state`, which indicates the current state of the connection.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `getsockopt()` with `TCP_INFO` to detect if the remote peer has closed its end of the connection:\n\n```c\n#include <linux/tcp.h>\n\nint detect_fin_packet(int socket) {\n    struct tcp_info tcp_info;\n    socklen_t optlen = sizeof(tcp_info);\n    int result = getsockopt(socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, &tcp_info, &optlen);\n    if (result == 0) {\n        if (tcp_info.tcpi_state == TCP_CLOSE_WAIT) {\n            // Remote peer has closed its end of the connection\n            return 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this approach is Linux-specific and may not work on other platforms.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ioctl()` function with the `SIOCINQ` command to retrieve the number of bytes in the receive queue. If the remote peer has closed its end of the connection, the receive queue will be empty, and `ioctl()` will return 0.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `ioctl()` with `SIOCINQ` to detect if the remote peer has closed its end of the connection:\n\n```c\nint detect_fin_packet(int socket) {\n    int bytes_in_queue = 0;\n    int result = ioctl(socket, SIOCINQ, &bytes_in_queue);\n    if (result == 0 && bytes_in_queue == 0) {\n        // Receive queue is empty, remote peer may have closed its end of the connection\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this approach is not foolproof, as the receive queue can be empty for other reasons as well.\n\nIn summary, detecting a FIN packet without reading from the socket is not straightforward, and the approaches mentioned above have their limitations. The most reliable way to detect a FIN packet is still to read from the socket and check for a return value of 0.","ts":1738215754.608}
{"role":"user","content":"it sounds like TCP_INFO is the way to go. another thing is, this is a tls stream, and the server sends an alert prior to closing the connection, that they are about to. i'm using boost::asio which uses openssl under the hood. can i detect that this alert has been received?","ts":1738215866.500}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can detect the TLS alert using OpenSSL. When a TLS alert is received, OpenSSL will generate a callback to notify the application. However, this callback is not enabled by default.\n\nTo enable the callback, you need to set up a custom OpenSSL context and configure it to call a callback function when a TLS alert is received.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this using Boost.Asio and OpenSSL:\n\n```cpp\n#include <boost/asio/ssl.hpp>\n#include <openssl/ssl.h>\n\n// Define a callback function to handle TLS alerts\nvoid tls_alert_callback(const SSL *ssl, int where, int ret) {\n    if (where & SSL_CB_ALERT) {\n        // TLS alert received, check the alert type\n        int alert_type = SSL_alert_type(ret);\n        int alert_desc = SSL_alert_desc(ret);\n        // Handle the alert accordingly\n        if (alert_type == SSL3_AL_WARNING && alert_desc == SSL_AD_CLOSE_NOTIFY) {\n            // Close notify alert received, handle it\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a custom OpenSSL context\nboost::asio::ssl::context create_ssl_context() {\n    boost::asio::ssl::context ctx(boost::asio::ssl::context::sslv23);\n    // Set up the callback function\n    SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(ctx.native_handle(), tls_alert_callback);\n    return ctx;\n}\n\n// Create an SSL socket using the custom context\nboost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket> create_ssl_socket(boost::asio::io_service &io_service) {\n    boost::asio::ssl::context ctx = create_ssl_context();\n    boost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket> ssl_socket(io_service, ctx);\n    return ssl_socket;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `tls_alert_callback` function is called whenever a TLS alert is received. The callback function checks the alert type and description, and handles the alert accordingly.\n\nNote that this approach requires you to create a custom OpenSSL context and set up the callback function manually. Also, the callback function is called for all TLS alerts, not just the close notify alert.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `SSL_get_alert_type` and `SSL_get_alert_desc` functions to check the alert type and description after a read operation on the SSL socket. These functions return the type and description of the last alert received on the SSL connection.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use these functions:\n\n```cpp\nboost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket> ssl_socket;\n// Read from the SSL socket\nboost::asio::streambuf buf;\nboost::asio::read(ssl_socket, buf);\n// Check the alert type and description\nint alert_type = SSL_get_alert_type(ssl_socket.native_handle());\nint alert_desc = SSL_get_alert_desc(ssl_socket.native_handle());\nif (alert_type == SSL3_AL_WARNING && alert_desc == SSL_AD_CLOSE_NOTIFY) {\n    // Close notify alert received, handle it\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SSL_get_alert_type` and `SSL_get_alert_desc` functions are used to check the alert type and description after a read operation on the SSL socket. If a close notify alert is received, the alert type and description are checked and handled accordingly.","ts":1738215900.057}
{"role":"user","content":"it has to happen after a read operation again? can i pass a ctx-specific user pointer to the info callback?","ts":1738216010.992}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you're correct that the `SSL_get_alert_type` and `SSL_get_alert_desc` functions require a read operation to be performed on the SSL socket before they can return the alert type and description.\n\nRegarding passing a context-specific user pointer to the info callback, yes, you can do that using the `SSL_CTX_set_ex_data` and `SSL_CTX_get_ex_data` functions.\n\nHere's an example of how you can pass a user pointer to the info callback:\n\n```cpp\n#include <openssl/ssl.h>\n\n// Define a structure to hold the user data\nstruct user_data {\n    // Add your user data here\n};\n\n// Define the info callback function\nvoid tls_alert_callback(const SSL *ssl, int where, int ret) {\n    // Get the user data from the SSL context\n    user_data *data = (user_data *)SSL_CTX_get_ex_data(SSL_get_SSL_CTX(ssl), 0);\n    // Handle the alert accordingly\n    if (where & SSL_CB_ALERT) {\n        // TLS alert received, check the alert type\n        int alert_type = SSL_alert_type(ret);\n        int alert_desc = SSL_alert_desc(ret);\n        // Handle the alert using the user data\n        if (alert_type == SSL3_AL_WARNING && alert_desc == SSL_AD_CLOSE_NOTIFY) {\n            // Close notify alert received, handle it using the user data\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a custom OpenSSL context\nboost::asio::ssl::context create_ssl_context(user_data *data) {\n    boost::asio::ssl::context ctx(boost::asio::ssl::context::sslv23);\n    // Set the user data in the SSL context\n    SSL_CTX_set_ex_data(ctx.native_handle(), 0, data);\n    // Set up the callback function\n    SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(ctx.native_handle(), tls_alert_callback);\n    return ctx;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `user_data` structure is used to hold the user data, and the `SSL_CTX_set_ex_data` function is used to set the user data in the SSL context. The `SSL_CTX_get_ex_data` function is then used to retrieve the user data in the info callback function.\n\nNote that the index used in the `SSL_CTX_set_ex_data` and `SSL_CTX_get_ex_data` functions is 0, which is a reserved index for application-specific data. You can use other indices if you need to store multiple types of data in the SSL context.","ts":1738216030.205}
