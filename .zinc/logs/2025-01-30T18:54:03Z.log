{"role":"assistant","content":"The issue you're experiencing is due to the default behavior of the `:term` command in Vim. When you press `Esc` twice, it sends a signal to the terminal to exit, which in turn terminates the process running inside it.\n\nThe reason for this behavior is that `:term` uses a terminal emulator that is designed to mimic the behavior of a traditional terminal. In a traditional terminal, pressing `Esc` twice is often used to signal the end of a process or to exit a program.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, you can try one of the following solutions:\n\n1. **Map `Esc` to something else**: Instead of mapping `Esc` to `^\\ ^n`, you could map it to something else that doesn't terminate the process. For example, you could map it to `Ctrl+C` which will interrupt the current command but not terminate the process.\n\n```vim\ntnoremap <Esc> <C-c>\n```\n\n2. **Use `:terminal ++noclose`**: You can use the `++noclose` option when running `:term` to prevent the terminal from closing when the process exits.\n\n```vim\n:term ++noclose ./chat\n```\n\n3. **Use a different terminal emulator**: If you're using a recent version of Vim, you can try using the `:terminal ++curwin` command instead of `:term`. This will run the terminal in the current window, and pressing `Esc` twice will not terminate the process.\n\n```vim\n:terminal ++curwin ./chat\n```\n\n4. **Disable the `Esc` key**: If you're prone to accidentally pressing `Esc` twice, you could disable the `Esc` key altogether when running `:term`. You can do this by adding the following line to your Vim configuration file:\n\n```vim\ntnoremap <Esc> <Nop>\n```\n\nThis will make the `Esc` key do nothing when pressed in terminal mode.\n\nRegarding the issue with deleting the previous line when it wraps during input, you might want to try using the `set ttimeoutlen=100` command in your Vim configuration file. This will set the timeout for terminal escape sequences to 100 milliseconds, which should give you enough time to delete the previous line without the terminal interpreting it as an escape sequence.\n\nAs for your functional palsy, you might want to consider using a keyboard with a slower repeat rate or adjusting the repeat delay on your current keyboard. This can help prevent accidental double presses. Additionally, you could try using a keyboard with a \"debounce\" feature, which can help filter out accidental key presses.","ts":1738263339.296}
