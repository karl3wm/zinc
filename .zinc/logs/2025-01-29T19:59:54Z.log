{"role":"user","content":"I'm moving from vim modelines to editorconfig. Some *.*pp files in subdirs end with a blank line followed by a line saying \"// vim: set ts=4 sw=4 et:\". Write a shell command to remove the last two lines from these files. Note: this is the only presence of the string 'vim:' in this directory tree.","ts":1738180836.169}
{"role":"assistant","content":"You can use the following shell command to remove the last two lines from the files that contain the vim modeline:\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.cpp\" -o -name \"*.hpp\" \\) -exec sed -i '/vim: set/d;$d' {} \\;\n```\n\nHowever, this command will remove the last line of every file, even if it doesn't contain the vim modeline. To avoid this, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.cpp\" -o -name \"*.hpp\" \\) -exec sed -i '/vim: set/{N;d}' {} \\;\n```\n\nThis command will remove the line containing \"vim: set\" and the next line (which is the last line of the file) only if the file contains the vim modeline.\n\nNote: The `{N;d}` in the sed command means: \n- `N` : read the next line into the pattern space (so now we have two lines in the pattern space)\n- `d` : delete the pattern space (which now contains the last two lines of the file)\n\nAlso, be careful when using the `-i` option with sed, as it will modify the files in-place without creating a backup. If you want to create a backup of the original files, you can use the `-i.bak` option instead, which will create a backup of each file with a `.bak` extension.","ts":1738180861.417}
