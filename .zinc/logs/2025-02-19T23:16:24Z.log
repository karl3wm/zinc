{"role":"assistant","content":"Asymmetric Streaming Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)\n=====================================================\n\nThe Asymmetric Streaming Longest Common Subsequence problem is a variation of the classic LCS problem. In this version, we have two sequences: a fixed-length pattern and a streaming sequence. The goal is to find the longest common subsequence between the pattern and the streaming sequence, with the constraint that the streaming sequence can only be accessed in a single pass.\n\nImplementation Approaches\n------------------------\n\nThere are several approaches to implementing Asymmetric Streaming LCS:\n\n### 1. Dynamic Programming\n\nOne approach is to use dynamic programming to build a 2D table, where each cell represents the length of the LCS between the pattern and the streaming sequence up to that point. However, this approach requires O(m*n) space and time complexity, where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the streaming sequence.\n\n### 2. Bitap Algorithm\n\nThe Bitap algorithm is a more efficient approach that uses bitwise operations to compute the LCS. It has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(m), making it more suitable for large streaming sequences.\n\n### 3. Suffix Tree\n\nAnother approach is to use a suffix tree data structure to store the pattern and the streaming sequence. This allows for efficient matching of substrings and can be used to compute the LCS.\n\nExample Code (Bitap Algorithm)\n-----------------------------\n\nHere is an example implementation of the Bitap algorithm in Python:\n```python\ndef asymmetric_streaming_lcs(pattern, stream):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the longest common subsequence between a fixed-length pattern and a streaming sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        pattern (str): The fixed-length pattern.\n        stream (generator): The streaming sequence.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The length of the LCS at each position in the streaming sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = len(pattern)\n    mask = (1 << m) - 1\n    state = 0\n\n    for char in stream:\n        # Update the state using bitwise operations\n        state = ((state << 1) | 1) & mask\n        for i in range(m):\n            if pattern[i] == char:\n                state |= 1 << i\n\n        # Compute the LCS length from the state\n        lcs_length = 0\n        while state:\n            lcs_length += 1\n            state &= state - 1\n\n        yield lcs_length\n\n# Example usage:\npattern = \"abc\"\nstream = (char for char in \"abcb","finish_reason":"length","ts":1.74002501094E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"ca\")\nfor lcs_length in asymmetric_streaming_lcs(pattern, stream):\n    print(lcs_length)\n```\nThis implementation uses the Bitap algorithm to compute the LCS length at each position in the streaming sequence. The `asymmetric_streaming_lcs` function takes a pattern and a streaming sequence as input and yields the LCS length at each position.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the streaming sequence is a generator that yields individual characters. You may need to modify the implementation to accommodate different types of streaming sequences.","finish_reason":"stop","ts":1.740025012154E9}
