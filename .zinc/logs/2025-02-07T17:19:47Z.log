{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you can use pragmas to disable `-Werror=comment` for specific parts of your code.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```c\n#pragma GCC diagnostic push\n#pragma GCC diagnostic warning \"-Wcomment\"\n// Your code that triggers the warning here\n#pragma GCC diagnostic pop\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `#pragma GCC diagnostic push` saves the current diagnostic settings.\n2. `#pragma GCC diagnostic warning \"-Wcomment\"` changes the `-Wcomment` error to a warning.\n3. `#pragma GCC diagnostic pop` restores the previous diagnostic settings.\n\nBy using these pragmas, you can disable the error for specific parts of your code without having to disable it for the entire compilation.\n\nNote: The above pragmas are specific to GCC and Clang compilers. If you're using a different compiler, the pragmas might be different.\n\nHere's an example for MSVC:\n\n```c\n#pragma warning(push)\n#pragma warning(disable: 4100) // MSVC warning for unreferenced formal parameter\n// Your code that triggers the warning here\n#pragma warning(pop)\n```\n\nHowever, MSVC does not have a direct equivalent warning for `-Wcomment`. The closest one is `C4067: unexpected tokens following preprocessor directive - expected a newline`. You can disable it using the following pragmas:\n\n```c\n#pragma warning(push)\n#pragma warning(disable: 4067)\n// Your code that triggers the warning here\n#pragma warning(pop)\n```","ts":1.738948824526E9}
{"role":"user","content":"the pragma doesn't seem to help ... are my eyes crossed and i've made an error somewhere? or is it possible it doesn't impact this error? is there a compiler flag that would accept this?","ts":1.738948900679E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"It's possible that the pragma doesn't impact this specific error. The `-Werror=comment` flag is a bit special, as it's not a traditional warning, but rather a way to make the compiler treat comments as errors.\n\nThe `#pragma GCC diagnostic` directives only work for warnings that are generated by the compiler's warning machinery. However, comments are processed by the preprocessor, which is a separate step from the compiler.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no `#pragma` directive that can disable `-Werror=comment`.\n\nAs for compiler flags, you can try using the `-Wno-error=comment` flag, which will disable the error for comments, but still generate a warning.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `-Wno-comment` flag, which will completely disable the warning for comments.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use these flags:\n\n```bash\ngcc -Wno-error=comment your_file.c\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\ngcc -Wno-comment your_file.c\n```\n\nKeep in mind that these flags will affect the entire compilation, not just a specific part of your code.\n\nIf you're using a build system like CMake or Make, you can add these flags to your build configuration.\n\nFor example, in CMake, you can add the following line to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n\n```cmake\nset(CMAKE_C_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -Wno-error=comment\")\n```\n\nOr, in a Makefile, you can add the following line:\n\n```makefile\nCFLAGS += -Wno-error=comment\n```","ts":1.738948909426E9}
