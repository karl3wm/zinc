{"role":"assistant","content":"Unfortunately, it seems that the `libxdiff` library used in Git is indeed a modified version of the original `libxdiff` library, and its documentation is not well-maintained.\n\nHowever, you can try the following options to find more up-to-date information:\n\n1. **Git's documentation**: Although there might not be a dedicated manpage for `libxdiff`, Git's documentation does cover some aspects of its diff algorithm and the `xdiff` library. You can check the Git documentation, particularly the sections on `git diff` and `git diff --help`.\n2. **Git's source code**: Since `libxdiff` is part of the Git source code, you can explore the source code itself to understand how the library is used and its functionality. The Git source code is available on GitHub or the Git website.\n3. **xdiff source code comments**: The `xdiff` source code files (e.g., `xdiff.h`, `xdiff.c`) contain comments that explain the purpose and behavior of the functions. While not a substitute for a manpage, these comments can provide valuable insights into the library's functionality.\n4. **Git mailing list archives**: You can search the Git mailing list archives for discussions related to `libxdiff`. This might help you find answers to specific questions or learn about changes made to the library over time.\n5. **Third-party documentation**: Some third-party projects, like `libgit2`, which is a Git library for other programming languages, might have documentation that covers `libxdiff` or similar diff algorithms.\n\nKeep in mind that `libxdiff` is a relatively low-level library, and its usage is mostly internal to Git. Therefore, documentation might be scarce, and exploring the source code or seeking help from the Git community might be necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the library.","ts":1.738874521061E9}
