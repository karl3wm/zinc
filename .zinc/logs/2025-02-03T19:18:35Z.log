{"role":"assistant","content":"The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vim's syntax highlighting engine has trouble parsing raw multiline string literals. One workaround is to add a Vim modeline or a directive to your file to adjust the syntax highlighting.\n\nHere are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. **Vim modeline**: You can add a Vim modeline at the top or bottom of your file to set the syntax highlighting options. For example:\n   ```vim\n# vim: set synmaxcol=200:\n```\n   This sets the maximum column for syntax highlighting to 200, which can help prevent Vim from getting confused by long multiline strings.\n\n2. **Vim directive**: Alternatively, you can add a Vim directive to your file to adjust the syntax highlighting. For example:\n   ```vim\n# vim: syntax sync minlines=100\n```\n   This directive tells Vim to synchronize the syntax highlighting every 100 lines, which can help prevent it from getting out of sync.\n\n3. **Vim ftplugin**: If you're using a specific file type (e.g., Python), you can create a ftplugin file to adjust the syntax highlighting settings for that file type. For example, you can create a file `~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim` with the following contents:\n   ```vim\nset synmaxcol=200\n```\n   This will set the maximum column for syntax highlighting to 200 for all Python files.\n\n4. **Vim syntax file**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try modifying the Vim syntax file for your specific file type. For example, you can edit the `~/.vim/syntax/python.vim` file to adjust the syntax highlighting rules.\n\nKeep in mind that these solutions may have varying degrees of success, and you may need to experiment with different settings to find one that works for your specific use case.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this issue may be fixed in newer versions of Vim, so if you're using an older version, you may want to consider upgrading.","ts":1.738610344451E9}
