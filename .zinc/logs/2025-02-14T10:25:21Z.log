{"role":"assistant","content":"In C++20, handling signals such as `SIGINT` (the interrupt signal, typically generated by pressing `Ctrl+C`) requires careful consideration, as signal handling in C++ is done through the C standard library, and C++ exceptions are not directly compatible with signal handling.\n\n### 1. Standard Exceptions for `SIGINT`\nThere is no standard C++ exception specifically for `SIGINT`. The `std::system_error` exception could be used to represent system-related errors, but it is not directly tied to signals like `SIGINT`. Instead, `SIGINT` is typically handled by a signal handler function, and you would need to design your own mechanism to propagate the signal's intent into your program's logic (e.g., throwing a custom exception).\n\n### 2. Using a Lambda as a Signal Handler\nA lambda **cannot** directly be used as a signal handler because the `signal` function (or `sigaction` in POSIX) expects a function pointer with a specific signature: `void (*)(int)`. A lambda that captures variables (non-capturing lambdas can be converted to function pointers) cannot be used directly.\n\nHowever, you can write a static or free function as the signal handler and then use a global or static variable to communicate with the rest of your program. For example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <csignal>\n#include <stdexcept>\n#include <atomic>\n\nstd::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\nvoid handleSigint(int signal) {\n    if (signal == SIGINT) {\n        sigintReceived = true;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n    try {\n        while (!sigintReceived) {\n            std::cout << \"Working...

{"role":"user","content":"ok so you're saying a lambda _can_ be used as a signal handler if you don't capture local values??\n","ts":1.739546807018E9}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, that's correct! In C++, a lambda **can** be used as a signal handler **if it does not capture any local values**. A non-capturing lambda is implicitly convertible to a function pointer, which means it matches the signature required by the `signal` function (i.e., `void (*)(int)`).\n\nHere’s an example demonstrating how to use a non-capturing lambda as a signal handler:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <csignal>\n#include <atomic>\n\nstd::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\nint main() {\n    // Define a non-capturing lambda as the signal handler\n    auto handler = [](int signal) {\n        if (signal == SIGINT) {\n            sigintReceived = true;\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Register the lambda as the handler for SIGINT\n    std::signal(SIGINT, handler);\n\n    std::cout << \"Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n    while (!sigintReceived) {\n        // Simulate work\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n        std::cout << \"Working...\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"SIGINT received, exiting gracefully.\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Non-Capturing Lambda**: The lambda `[](int signal) { ... }` does not capture any variables, so it can be implicitly converted to a function pointer of type `void (*)(int)`.\n2. **Signal Handler Function Pointer**: The `std::signal` function requires a function pointer of type `void (*)(int)`, and the non-capturing lambda satisfies this requirement.\n3. **Capturing Lambdas**: If the lambda captures variables (e.g., `[&sigintReceived](int signal) { ... }`), it cannot be converted to a function pointer and thus cannot be used directly as a signal handler.\n\nIf you need to access or modify external state (e.g., `sigintReceived` in the example), use a non-capturing lambda and rely on global or `static` variables (or atomic variables, as in the example) to communicate between the signal handler and the rest of your program.","ts":1.739546824687E9}

Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working...

For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working...

For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

{"role":"assistant","content":"You're absolutely right that there isn't a standard error code specifically for `SIGINT` in C++ or its standard library. However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working... Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

{"role":"assistant","content":"You're absolutely right that there isn't a standard error code specifically for `SIGINT` in C++ or its standard library. However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working... Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

{"role":"assistant","content":"You're absolutely right that there isn't a standard error code specifically for `SIGINT` in C++ or its standard library. However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working... Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

{"role":"assistant","content":"You're absolutely right that there isn't a standard error code specifically for `SIGINT` in C++ or its standard library. However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working... Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.

{"role":"assistant","content":"You're absolutely right that there isn't a standard error code specifically for `SIGINT` in C++ or its standard library. However, if you're looking for an **intuitive system error code** to represent the interruption caused by `SIGINT`, you can use one of the **POSIX error codes** that conveys the idea of interruption or cancellation. Here are some options that might work well for internal catching:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **`EINTR` (Interrupted System Call)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used when a system call is interrupted by a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`).\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: Since `SIGINT` interrupts the program, `EINTR` is a natural fit for signaling that an operation was interrupted by the user (e.g., pressing `Ctrl+C`).\n   - **Usage example**:\n     ```cpp\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <csignal>\n     #include <system_error>\n     #include <atomic>\n\n     std::atomic<bool> sigintReceived{false};\n\n     void handleSigint(int signal) {\n         if (signal == SIGINT) {\n             sigintReceived = true;\n         }\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         std::signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);\n\n         try {\n             while (!sigintReceived) {\n                 std::cout << \"Working... Press Ctrl+C to interrupt.\" << std::endl;\n                 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n             }\n             throw std::system_error(EINTR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n         } catch (const std::system_error& e) {\n             std::cerr << \"Error: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n         }\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **`ECANCELED` (Operation Canceled)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is used when an operation (e.g., a thread or I/O operation) is canceled.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: `SIGINT` effectively cancels the program's current operation, so `ECANCELED` can be a good choice for signaling this behavior.\n   - **Usage example**:\n     Replace `EINTR` with `ECANCELED` in the above example.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`EOWNERDEAD` (Owner Died)**\n   - **What it means**: This error code is typically used in synchronization primitives when the owner of a resource (e.g., a mutex) has died.\n   - **Why it’s intuitive**: While less common, `EOWNERDEAD` could be used metaphorically to indicate that the \"owner\" of the program (the user) has terminated it via `SIGINT`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom Error Code**\n   - If none of the standard error codes feel intuitive, you can define your own error code specifically for `SIGINT`. For example:\n     ```cpp\n     constexpr int SIGINT_ERROR = 255; // Custom error code\n     ```\n   - Then use it with `std::system_error`:\n     ```cpp\n     throw std::system_error(SIGINT_ERROR, std::system_category(), \"SIGINT received, program interrupted.\");\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n| Error Code     | Description                            | Intuitive for `SIGINT`? |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| `EINTR`        | Interrupted system call                 | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `ECANCELED`    | Operation canceled                     | ✅ Yes                  |\n| `EOWNERDEAD`   | Owner died                             | 🟡 Maybe                |\n| Custom Code    | Defined specifically for `SIGINT`     | ✅ Yes (if you prefer)  |\n\n### Recommendation\n`EINTR` is the most intuitive choice for representing `SIGINT` because it directly relates to interruptions caused by signals.
