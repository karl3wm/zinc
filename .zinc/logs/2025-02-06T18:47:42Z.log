The goal of xdiffpp is to provide a modern and easy-to-use C++ interface to the xdiff library, making it easier for developers to integrate xdiff functionality into their applications.\n\n**Goals**\n\n* Provide a C++ wrapper for the xdiff library that is easy to use and understand.\n* Support all the features of the xdiff library, including text and binary diff, patch, and merge.\n* Use modern C++ features and best practices to ensure the wrapper is efficient, reliable, and maintainable.\n* Provide documentation and examples to help developers get started with using xdiffpp.\n\n**Task List**\n\n1. **Initial Setup**\n        * Create a new C++ project for xdiffpp.\n        * Set up the build system (e.g., CMake) to compile and link against the xdiff library.\n        * Done!\n2. **xdiff Library Analysis**\n        * Study the xdiff library documentation and source code to understand its API and functionality.\n        * Identify the key functions and data structures that need to be wrapped.\n3. **C++ Wrapper Implementation**\n        * Implement the C++ wrapper for the xdiff library, starting with the basic functions (e.g., `xdl_diff`, `xdl_patch`, `xdl_merge`).\n        * Use modern C++ features (e.g., smart pointers, containers) to ensure the wrapper is efficient and easy to use.\n4. **Text Diff Implementation**\n        * Implement the text diff functionality, including support for different diff algorithms (e.g., Myers, patience, histogram).\n        * Provide options for customizing the diff output (e.g., context size, ignore whitespace).\n5. **Binary Diff Implementation**\n        * Implement the binary diff functionality, including support for different diff algorithms (e.g., Rabin's polynomial fingerprinting).\n        * Provide options for customizing the diff output (e.g., block size).\n6. **Patch Implementation**\n        * Implement the patch functionality, including support for applying patches to files.\n        * Provide options for customizing the patch output (e.g., ignore whitespace).\n7. **Merge Implementation**\n        * Implement the merge functionality, including support for merging three files.\n        * Provide options for customizing the merge output (e.g., conflict marker size).\n8. **Testing and Debugging**\n        * Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the wrapper is working correctly.\n        * Debug any issues that arise during testing.\n9. **Documentation and Examples**\n        * Write documentation for the xdiffpp wrapper, including API documentation and user guides.\n        * Provide examples of how to use the wrapper in different scenarios.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n* A fully functional C++ wrapper for the xdiff library (xdiffpp).\n* Documentation for the xdiffpp wrapper, including API documentation and user guides.\n* Examples of how to use the wrapper in different scenarios.\n\n```\n\n**2025-02-06-find_output.txt**\n```\n$ find ref/git/xdiff ref/xdiff ref/libxdiff -name *.txt -o -name *.c* -o -name *.h*\nref/git/xdiff/xdiffi.h\nref/git/xdiff/xtypes.h\nref/git/xdiff/xinclude.h\nref/git/xdiff/xemit.h\nref/git/xdiff/xutils.h\nref/git/xdiff/xemit.c\nref/git/xdiff/xmerge.c\nref/git/xdiff/xdiffi.c\nref/git/xdiff/xpatience.c\nref/git/xdiff/xmacros.h\nref/git/xdiff/xprepare.c\nref/git/xdiff/xhistogram.c\nref/git/xdiff/xprepare.h\nref/git/xdiff/xutils.c\nref/git/xdiff/xdiff.h\nref/xdiff/xdiffi.h\nref/xdiff/xtypes.h\nref/xdiff/xinclude.h\nref/xdiff/xemit.h\nref/xdiff/git-xdiff.h\nref/xdiff/xutils.h\nref/xdiff/CMakeLists.txt\nref/xdiff/xemit.c\nref/xdiff/xmerge.c\nref/xdiff/xdiffi.c\nref/xdiff/xpatience.c\nref/xdiff/xmacros.h\nref/xdiff/xprepare.c\nref/xdiff/xhistogram.c\nref/xdiff/xprepare.h\nref/xdiff/xutils.c\nref/xdiff/xdiff.h\nref/libxdiff/config.h.in\nref/libxdiff/tools/xrabin.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xdiffi.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xmissing.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xtypes.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xmerge3.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xrabdiff.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xinclude.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xadler32.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xemit.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xbdiff.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xpatchi.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xversion.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xutils.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xbpatchi.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xrabply.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xemit.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xdiffi.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xadler32.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xmacros.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xprepare.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xprepare.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xalloc.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xbdiff.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xmissing.h\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xutils.c\nref/libxdiff/xdiff/xdiff.h\nref/libxdiff/CMakeLists.txt\nref/libxdiff/man/xdiff.html\nref/libxdiff/man/xdiff.txt\nref/libxdiff/man/xdiff-lib.html\nref/libxdiff/test/xtestutils.c\nref/libxdiff/test/xdiff_test.c\nref/libxdiff/test/xregression.c\nref/libxdiff/test/xtestutils.h\n\n```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n","ts":1.738867662255E9}
