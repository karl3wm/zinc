{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, I'm familiar with edlib. Edlib is a lightweight, open-source, C library for computing edit distances and alignments between strings. Here's a basic implementation of a Diff-Match-Patch-compatible adapter for edlib in C++ using the standard library:\n\n```cpp\n#include <edlib.h>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nclass EdlibAdapter {\npublic:\n    struct Diff {\n        enum Type { EQUAL, INSERT, DELETE };\n        Type type;\n        std::string text;\n    };\n\n    EdlibAdapter(const std::string& a, const std::string& b)\n        : a_(a), b_(b) {}\n\n    std::vector<Diff> getDiffs() {\n        unsigned char* const a = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(const_cast<char*>(a_.c_str()));\n        unsigned char* const b = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(const_cast<char*>(b_.c_str()));\n        int aLen = a_.size();\n        int bLen = b_.size();\n\n        unsigned char* alignment = edlibAlign(a, aLen, b, bLen, edlibDefaultAlignConfig());\n        if (!alignment) {\n            throw std::runtime_error(\"edlibAlign failed\");\n        }\n\n        std::vector<Diff> diffs;\n        int aPos = 0;\n        int bPos = 0;\n        while (aPos < aLen || bPos < bLen) {\n            int aCount = 0;\n            int bCount = 0;\n            while (aPos + aCount < aLen && bPos + bCount < bLen && alignment[aPos + aCount] == alignment[bPos + bCount]) {\n                ++aCount;\n                ++bCount;\n            }\n\n            if (aCount > 0) {\n                diffs.push_back({Diff::EQUAL, a_.substr(aPos, aCount)});\n                aPos += aCount;\n                bPos += bCount;\n            }\n\n            aCount = 0;\n            while (aPos + aCount < aLen && alignment[aPos + aCount] != 0) {\n                ++aCount;\n            }\n\n            if (aCount > 0) {\n                diffs.push_back({Diff::DELETE, a_.substr(aPos, aCount)});\n                aPos += aCount;\n            }\n\n            bCount = 0;\n            while (bPos + bCount < bLen && alignment[bPos + bCount] == 0) {\n                ++bCount;\n            }\n\n            if (bCount > 0) {\n                diffs.push_back({Diff::INSERT, b_.substr(bPos, bCount)});\n                bPos += bCount;\n            }\n        }\n\n        free(alignment);\n        return diffs;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::string a_;\n    std::string b_;\n};\n```\n\nThis adapter takes two strings `a` and `b` in its constructor and provides a `getDiffs` method that returns a vector of `Diff` structures. Each `Diff` structure contains a `type` field (EQUAL, INSERT, or DELETE) and a `text` field representing the corresponding text.\n\nYou can use this adapter as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    EdlibAdapter adapter(\"kitten\", \"sitting\");\n    std::vector<EdlibAdapter::Diff> diffs = adapter.getDiffs();\n\n    for (const auto& diff : diffs) {\n        switch (diff.type) {\n            case EdlibAdapter::Diff::EQUAL:\n                std::cout << \"EQUAL: \" << diff.text << std::endl;\n                break;\n            case EdlibAdapter::Diff::INSERT:\n                std::cout << \"INSERT: \" << diff.text << std::endl;\n                break;\n            case EdlibAdapter::Diff::DELETE:\n                std::cout << \"DELETE: \" << diff.text << std::endl;\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis will output the differences between the strings \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" in a format compatible with the Diff-Match-Patch library.","ts":1.738816048827E9}
