- General prompt formats involving tool calls are at github.com/huggingface/transformers docs/source/en/chat_templat*
- The prompt formats that llama models are trained on are at https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models
    under models/llama[ver]/prompt_format.md where [ver] is among [2,3,3_1,3_2,3_3,...]
  There are extensive further prompt formats in github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack .
- Tulu prompt formats (and others) i found at https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/eval/templates.py
    the tulu paper likely is a more official resource of course the right area of code can be more correct
- DeepSeek-V3 chat template is at https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json

Next I would like to add data storage, such as sqlite3.

The intent is to have a configuration store that can store api endpoints and more.
